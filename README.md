# Roseluster

Roseluster is a theme adapted from [lackluster.nvim](https://github.com/slugbyte/lackluster.nvim) with inspiration for colors from [darkrose.nvim](https://github.com/water-sucks/darkrose.nvim).

Configuration should work very similar to as described in the lackluster README, with a few additional colors.
